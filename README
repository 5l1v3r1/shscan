shscan looks for non-default ssh ports.  It does so in a multithreaded environment; it has a really basic port scanner (use nmap if you want flexability!) and can work with port ranges.  It looks 
for these ports by creating a faux SSH connection and attempting to validate with some bogus creds
This is obviously loud and probably going to be logged and set off an IDS or two, but it's more 
accurate than fingerprinting TCP packets.

Running a scan of all 65,535 ports doesn't take that long, so don't be afraid of it.   

This uses paramiko SSH libs and a few other standard ones.
