shscan looks for non-default ssh ports.  It does so in a multithreaded environment; it has a really basic port scanner (use nmap if you want flexability!) and can work with port ranges.  It looks for these ports by creating a faux SSH 
connection and attempting to validate with some bogus creds.  This is obviously loud and probably going to be logged and set off an IDS or two, but it's more accurate than fingerprinting TCP packets.

Running a scan of all 65,535 ports doesn't take that long, so don't be afraid of it.   

This uses paramiko SSH libs and a few other standard ones.

shscan automatically generates the maximum number of threads that can be 
generated on your system.  This is done by taking the total RAM on the box and
dividing it by the currently set ulimit -s.  Thanks to the below blog for
the information:

If you get [-] can't start new thread, then ulimit is set too high or there's
some issues with how i'm calculating it.  You can shoot me an email if you
feel so inclined.
