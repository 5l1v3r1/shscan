shscan looks for non-default ssh ports.  It does so in a multithreaded environment; it has a really basic port scanner (use nmap if you want flexability!) and can work with port ranges.  It looks for these ports by creating a faux SSH 
connection and attempting to validate with some bogus creds.  This is obviously loud and probably going to be logged and set off an IDS or two, but it's more accurate than fingerprinting TCP packets.

Running a scan of all 65,535 ports doesn't take that long, so don't be afraid of it.   

This uses paramiko SSH libs and a few other standard ones.

Currently working on maximizing the number of parallel threads on a per system
basis.  There's a weird issue involving max proc threads related to ulimit and
system memory.  More information here:
