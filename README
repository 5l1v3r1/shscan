shscan looks for non-default ssh ports.  It does so in a multithreaded environment; has a really basic port scanner (use nmap if you want flexability!) and can work with port ranges.  It looks for these ports by creating a faux SSH connection and attempting to validate with some bogus creds.  This is obviously loud and probably going to be logged and set off an IDS or two, but it's more accurate than fingerprinting TCP packets.
